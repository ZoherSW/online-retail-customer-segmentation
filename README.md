Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) techniques, the project identifies distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior. The goal is to derive actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies and lay the groundwork for future machine learning applications.
